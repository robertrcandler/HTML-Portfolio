      <h3>My Resume</h3>
      <p>Hello Again! I wanted to give some context about my resume, so here is my story. After highschool, I went to Texas A&M to study engineering for a couple of years but 
        ultimately was not happy with what I was doing and wanted to switch
        majors to something programming related like computer science. However, instead of spending 3 more years in university I decided to enroll into the University of Texas
        Coding BootCamp (only 3 intense months instead). I have recently graduated and am looking for a position as a Junior Web Developer. My Resume does not have a Work Experience
        section because while I have held several side jobs, I no relevant coding work experience. At A&M, I learned several programming languages (Java, Matlab, LabView, VBA, R, 
        CAD, Simio, Arena) but not enough to be considered a relevant skill (without a few days of relearning). It was these courses that sparked my interest in programming and gave
        me what I consider to be my biggest strength: the ability to quickly pick up new programs. If you are looking for someone who can learn programming on the job, that's me!
